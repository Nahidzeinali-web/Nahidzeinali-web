## 👋 Hi there — I'm Nahid Zeinali

I'm a Senior AI Research and Data Scientist with over 9 years of experience at the intersection of software engineering, healthcare, and artificial intelligence. I hold a Ph.D. in Informatics from the University of Iowa, where my research focused on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) to enhance clinical decision support and symptom detection.

Currently at the FAIR DATA INNOVATION HUB, I design and deploy end-to-end AI solutions for biomedical research, encompassing LLMOps pipelines, data engineering, and scalable, cloud-native deployments. My expertise spans generative AI, clinical NLP, MLOps/LLMOps, and AI-driven application development.

🔍 I’m passionate about transforming research into real-world impact through AI-powered tools that advance healthcare, science, and evidence-based decision-making.
